## Website

The website is hosted on Github Pages and is based on Jekyll with the [Jekyll Documentation Theme](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html).

## Interface with Globus

The metadata and URLs of the files hosted on Globus is generated by custom scripts developed by Rick Wagner (University of California San Diego) to query the Globus API and create Markdown files automatically, that can then be processed by Jekyll.
The scripts are available in the [`CMB-S4/serverless-data-portal-cmb-s4` Github repository](https://github.com/CMB-S4/serverless-data-portal-cmb-s4).

## Inspiration

An inspiration for this concept is the [X-ray Tomography Data Bank](https://tomobank.readthedocs.io/). TomoBank uses a Globus collection at Argonne to store files and publishes descriptions of its datasets on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org). Because the dataset metadata is on Github in the [TomoBank repo](https://github.com/tomography/tomobank), users can submit new datasets through pull requests.
